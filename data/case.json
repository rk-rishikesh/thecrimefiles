    "caseReport": "On the humid night of November 15, 2025, around 11:40 PM, neighbors in a Palermo apartment block reported hearing faint techno beats followed by the sound of shattering glass.\nWhen officers entered Apartment 8C, Calle Honduras 4621, they found Tomás Cabrera face-down on the living room floor, blood pooling beneath his head.\nThe balcony door was open, curtains fluttering, and a laptop screen still glowed faintly with a wallet dashboard frozen mid-transaction.\nPreliminary autopsy confirms death by blunt force trauma to the skull, consistent with impact from a metal DJ turntable base found near the victim (Item ID: E-01).\nThe estimated time of death is recorded around 23:10–23:30 hrs. No immediate signs of forced entry observed; apartment door lock intact.\nOn November 14, just a day before the murder Tomás executed a massive cross-chain stable coin transfer from Avalanche chain to Base chain, equivalent to $820,000 USD using only swaps, a cross-chain token transfer protocol powered by dcipher network.\n only swaps is known for its fast cross chain swap transaction times, so the transaction was confirmed on-chain in a flash, but the destination wallet was new and never publicly linked to Tomás.\nPolice found a hardware wallet in a drawer, wiped clean reset at 10:57 PM, just minutes before the estimated murder time.\nEvidence suggests the homicide occurred within minutes of a digital asset transfer.\nThe timing of the wallet reset and the absence of recovery credentials indicate deliberate tampering by an individual with direct physical access to the apartment.\nFurther blockchain and forensic correlation is underway to determine whether the $820,000 transfer and the fatal assault are causally linked.",
